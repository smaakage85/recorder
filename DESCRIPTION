Description: A lightweight toolkit to check and validate new observations 
    before computing their predictions with a machine learning model. The
    validation process consists of two steps: (1) estimate/record relevant 
    parameters and metadata from the training data set for a machine learning 
    model and (2) run a number of basic tests on a new set of observations 
    using the recorded parameters.
