Description: A lightweight toolkit to validate new observations when computing
    their predictions with a machine learning model. The validation process 
    consists of two steps: (1) record relevant statistics and metadata of the
    variables from the original training data and (2) use these data to run 
    basic validation tests on the new set of observations.
