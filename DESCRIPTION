Description: A lightweight toolkit to validate new observations when computing
    their predictions with a predictive model. The validation process 
    consists of two steps: (1) record relevant statistics and meta data of the
    variables in the original training data for the predictive model and
    (2) use these data to run a set of basic validation tests on the new set of 
    observations.
