[![Travis-CI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/smaakage85/customsteps.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/smaakage85/recordr)

`recordr` is a lightweight toolkit to test and validate new observations
when predicting them with a Machine Learning model. The validation process 
consists of two steps: 

1.  estimate/record relevant statistics and metadata of the variables from the 
training data set for a machine learning model
2.  run a number of basic tests on a new set of observations using the recorded 
statistics and metadata.

## Installation

`recordr` can be installed from CRAN with `install.packages('recordr')`. 
If you want the development version then install directly from GitHub:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("smaakage85/recordr")
```
