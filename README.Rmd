[![Travis-CI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/smaakage85/customsteps.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/smaakage85/recordr)
[![CRAN\_Release\_Badge](http://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version-ago/modelgrid)](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=recordr) [![CRAN\_Download\_Badge](http://cranlogs.r-pkg.org/badges/modelgrid)](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=recordr)

`recordr` is a lightweight toolkit to validate new observations when computing
their predictions with a machine learning model. The validation process 
consists of two steps: 

1. record relevant statistics and meta data of the
variables from the original training data for the machine learning model 
2. use these data to run a set of basic validation tests on the new set of 
observations.

## Installation

`recordr` can be installed from CRAN with `install.packages('recordr')`. 
If you want the development version then install directly from GitHub:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("smaakage85/recordr")
```

## Basics

Load package.

```{r}
library(recordr)
```

Divide `iris` into training data and new data.

```{r}
set.seed(1)
trn_idx <- sample(seq_len(nrow(iris)), 100)
data_training <- iris[trn_idx, ]
data_new <- iris[-trn_idx, ]
```

Record statistics and meta data of training data.

```{r}
tape <- record(data_training)
```

Run validation tests on new data with `play`.

```{r}
playback <- play(tape, data_new)
```

Print test results.

```{r}
playback
```

You can then extract the results of (any) failed tests for the rows of new data
with `get_failed_tests()`:

```{r}
failed_tests <- get_failed_tests(playback)
# print.
kable(head(failed_tests, 15))
```

If you to know more about all of the exciting features of `recordr`, take a 
look at the vignette.
